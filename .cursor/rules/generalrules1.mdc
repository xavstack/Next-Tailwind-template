- Avoid sludge when attempting feature fixes or debugs, using branches if things are getting messy in the codebase. 
- DOn't blindly agree with the user. Think and analyse prompts that don't 100% make sense. 
- Follow the comprehensive .cursorrules file for all development
- Always test with npm run dev after major changes
- Commit frequently with conventional commit messages
