# Smart AI Guidance Implementation Guide

_Making the Template's AI Assistant Contextually Intelligent_

> **Goal**: Transform the AI from a passive code generator into an active development partner that provides timely, relevant suggestions without being intrusive.

---

## 🎯 **Quick Start for Developers**

### **Activate Smart Guidance**

1. **Environment Setup** (Optional but recommended):

```bash
# Add to .env.local for customization
ENABLE_AI_GUIDANCE=true
AI_GUIDANCE_LEVEL=medium  # low|medium|high
ENABLE_FEATURE_DISCOVERY=true
```

2. **Request Contextual Help**:

```
"What template features should I consider for this [component/API/page]?"
"Show me best practices for what I'm currently working on"
"What optimization opportunities are available here?"
```

3. **Natural Workflow Integration**:

- AI will automatically suggest based on current file context
- Milestone prompts appear after completing features
- Feature discovery happens when working in related areas

## 🚀 **Practical Usage Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Building a New Component**

**Current Context**: Working in `src/components/UserProfile.tsx`

**AI Contextual Guidance**:

```
💡 Component Development Checklist:
• Testing: Create __tests__/UserProfile.test.tsx for this component
• Animation: Consider fade-in transitions (see examples/AnimatedCard.tsx)
• Accessibility: Use Radix primitives for interactive elements
• Styling: Use CSS variables for theme consistency

Template Resources Available:
• shadcn/ui components: npx shadcn@latest add [component]
• Animation examples: components/examples/
• Testing patterns: __tests__/example.test.tsx
```

### **Scenario 2: Creating an API Route**

**Current Context**: Working in `src/app/api/users/route.ts`

**AI Contextual Guidance**:

```
🔒 API Security & Quality Reminders:
• Validation: Add Zod schema for request/response (see contact/route.ts)
• Rate Limiting: Consider IP-based limits for public endpoints
• Error Handling: Sanitize error messages for production
• Testing: Add API tests with MSW patterns

Security Checklist:
• Input validation with Zod ✓
• Proper error handling ✓
• Rate limiting (if public) ⏳
• Authentication (if required) ⏳
```

### **Scenario 3: Implementing Authentication**

**Current Context**: Adding login functionality

**AI Milestone Guidance**:

```
🔐 Post-Auth Implementation Opportunities:
• Middleware: Create protected route patterns
• Components: User profile, settings, dashboard layouts
• Security: Session management and logout flows
• Testing: Auth-specific test scenarios

Template Capabilities Ready:
• Middleware patterns for route protection
• Form components with validation
• State management with SWR
• Theme-aware components
```

### **Scenario 4: Performance Optimization**

**Current Context**: Before production deployment

**AI Deployment Guidance**:

```
🚀 Pre-Deployment Optimization Checklist:
• Bundle Analysis: Run npm run build and check output
• Performance: Consider Lighthouse CI integration
• Monitoring: Enable error tracking (Sentry, Vercel Analytics)
• SEO: Verify metadata and sitemap generation

Template Features Available:
• Quality scripts: ./scripts/quality/ci-check.sh
• SEO utilities: lib/seo.ts (createPageSEO, structured data)
• Performance monitoring ready for integration
```

## 🧠 **Smart Suggestion Logic**

### **File Context Detection**

The AI analyzes your current work context:

```typescript
// Automatic context detection
const context = {
  currentFile: "src/components/Dashboard.tsx",
  fileType: "component",
  imports: ["useState", "framer-motion", "shadcn/ui"],
  patterns: ["form", "data-fetching", "responsive"],
  stage: "development", // development|testing|deployment
};

// Generated suggestions based on context
const suggestions = generateContextualGuidance(context);
```

### **Intelligent Timing**

**Good Moments for Suggestions**:

- ✅ After saving a file (natural pause)
- ✅ When opening related files
- ✅ After completing a function/component
- ✅ Before git commits
- ✅ When switching between feature areas

**Avoided Interruptions**:

- ❌ During active typing
- ❌ While debugging errors
- ❌ During complex refactoring
- ❌ When under time pressure (CI failures, etc.)

## 🎨 **Customizing Your Guidance Experience**

### **Guidance Levels**

**Low Level** (Essential only):

```
• Security vulnerabilities
• Performance critical issues
• Build/compilation errors
• Accessibility violations
```

**Medium Level** (Recommended):

```
+ Best practice reminders
+ Testing suggestions
+ Template feature discovery
+ Optimization opportunities
```

**High Level** (Comprehensive):

```
+ Advanced feature suggestions
+ Architecture improvements
+ Experimental features
+ Detailed optimization guides
```

### **Custom Request Patterns**

**Direct Feature Discovery**:

```
"What animation options does this template provide?"
"Show me all form validation patterns available"
"What testing tools are configured and ready?"
```

**Milestone-Based Requests**:

```
"I just finished the user authentication, what should I consider next?"
"My API is working, what optimization/security steps should I take?"
"Ready to deploy, what checklist should I follow?"
```

**Best Practice Queries**:

```
"Is this component following template best practices?"
"How can I improve the performance of this page?"
"What accessibility improvements can I make here?"
```
