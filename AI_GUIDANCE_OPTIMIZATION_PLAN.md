## üõ†Ô∏è **HIGH IMPACT TASK SPECIFICATIONS**

### **Task H1: Specification-First Development Protocol**

**Status**: ‚ùå NOT STARTED  
**Problem**: AI exhibits implementation-first behavior, bypassing investigation phases and causing token waste through iteration loops [[memory:693264]]

**Anti-Pattern Addressed**: Research shows 70% of AI coding failures stem from insufficient problem definition and requirements gathering before implementation begins.

**Specific Implementation**:

Update `.cursorrules` with mandatory specification protocol:

```yaml
development_workflow:
  size_gate_check:
    - "If diff <15 LOC and no test failures: proceed with direct patch"
    - "Otherwise: follow full specification workflow"

  phase_1_investigation:
    - "REPRODUCE: Describe the exact current behavior observed"
    - "DEFINE: State the specific desired outcome with measurable criteria"
    - "CONSTRAINTS: List technical, architectural, and design limitations"
    - "SUCCESS_CRITERIA: Define verifiable completion conditions"

  phase_2_specification:
    - "Create brief technical specification before code changes"
    - "Include: affected components, implementation approach, testing strategy"
    - "For complex changes: request human validation before proceeding"

  phase_3_implementation:
    - "Implement according to approved specification"
    - "Validate against defined success criteria"
    - "Document any specification deviations"

context_window_management:
  - "Use unified-diff format for all changes"
  - "Cap responses at 600 tokens maximum"
  - "Prioritize relevant context over comprehensive explanations"

mandatory_investigation_questions:
  - "What specific behavior needs modification?"
  - "How will successful implementation be verified?"
  - "What components might be affected by this change?"
```

**Files to Update**:

- `.cursorrules` (add specification-first workflow)
- `docs/ai-agents/debugging-protocol.md` (new file)

**Success Criteria**: AI demonstrates specification-first behavior with investigation phases before implementation

---

### **Task H2: Systematic Debugging Workflow**

**Status**: ‚ùå NOT STARTED  
**Problem**: AI exhibits dead loop behavior when debugging, using trial-and-error approaches rather than systematic problem-solving

**Anti-Pattern Addressed**: Unstructured debugging leads to repetitive iteration cycles without progress, identified as primary cause of development velocity loss.

**Specific Implementation**:

Create systematic debugging protocol in `.cursorrules`:

```yaml
debugging_workflow:
  step_1_reproduce:
    - "Request detailed reproduction steps from user"
    - "Gather diagnostic information (console output, error messages)"
    - "Identify specific component or system exhibiting the issue"

  step_2_localize:
    - "Examine the identified component implementation"
    - "Review related dependencies and configurations"
    - "Compare with similar working implementations"

  step_3_diagnose:
    - "Identify root cause category (logic, styling, configuration, dependencies)"
    - "Explain why current implementation produces observed behavior"
    - "Propose minimal targeted fix addressing root cause"

  step_4_verify:
    - "Validate fix against original reproduction steps"
    - "Test for potential regression in related functionality"
    - "Document solution for future reference"

debugging_categories:
  layout_issues: "Analyze container structure, sizing constraints, and overflow behavior"
  asset_loading: "Verify resource paths, loading states, and error handling"
  responsive_behavior: "Test interaction patterns across viewport breakpoints"
  state_management: "Examine data flow, state updates, and side effects"
```

**Files to Update**:

- `.cursorrules` (add debugging workflow)
- `docs/ai-agents/debugging-protocol.md` (new file)

**Success Criteria**: AI follows systematic debugging approach, eliminating trial-and-error iteration cycles

---

### **Task H3: Evaluation-First Implementation**

**Status**: ‚ùå NOT STARTED  
**Problem**: AI implements solutions without predefined success criteria, leading to solution drift and incomplete implementations

**Anti-Pattern Addressed**: Lack of validation frameworks causes AI to continue iterating without clear completion criteria, identified as major source of token waste.

**Specific Implementation**:

Add evaluation framework to `.cursorrules`:

```yaml
implementation_framework:
  pre_implementation_requirements:
    - "Define specific, measurable success criteria"
    - "Identify validation approach and testing strategy"
    - "Enumerate potential edge cases and failure modes"

  success_criteria_categories:
    functional_requirements:
      - "Feature operates as specified in user requirements"
      - "No regression in existing functionality"
      - "Appropriate error handling for edge cases"

    technical_requirements:
      - "Implementation follows template architectural patterns"
      - "No console errors or warnings introduced"
      - "Maintains performance characteristics"

    user_experience_requirements:
      - "Responsive behavior across target viewport sizes"
      - "Accessibility standards compliance"
      - "Consistent with existing design system"

validation_protocol:
  - "Implementation satisfies all defined success criteria"
  - "Edge cases handled appropriately"
  - "No unintended side effects detected"
  - "Solution tested across target environments"
```

**Files to Update**:

- `.cursorrules` (add evaluation framework)
- `docs/ai-agents/evaluation-templates.md` (new file)

**Success Criteria**: AI defines and validates against success criteria before considering implementation complete

---

## üìã **MEDIUM IMPACT TASK SPECIFICATIONS**

### **Task M1: Template-Specific Context Enhancement**

**Status**: ‚ùå NOT STARTED  
**Problem**: AI generates generic solutions without leveraging template-specific architectural patterns and established conventions

**Anti-Pattern Addressed**: Context window degradation causes AI to ignore relevant architectural decisions and proven solution patterns.

**Specific Implementation**:

Enhance `.cursorrules` with template-aware guidance:

```yaml
template_architecture_awareness:
  component_architecture: "Prioritize shadcn/ui components from /components/ui"
  styling_methodology: "Enforce Tailwind utilities, minimize custom CSS"
  animation_framework: "Leverage Framer Motion patterns from /components/examples"
  data_management: "Use SWR with lib/fetcher.ts for consistency"

  architectural_patterns:
    component_composition:
      - "Compose complex components from primitive shadcn/ui elements"
      - "Maintain separation of concerns between logic and presentation"
      - "Follow established prop patterns and TypeScript interfaces"

    responsive_implementation:
      - "Mobile-first responsive design approach"
      - "Consistent breakpoint usage across components"
      - "Proper focus management for accessibility"

    performance_optimization:
      - "Next.js Image component for asset optimization"
      - "Appropriate loading states for async operations"
      - "Bundle size considerations for new dependencies"

solution_guidance:
  layout_challenges: "Analyze container structure, flexbox/grid patterns, and overflow handling"
  interaction_patterns: "Reference existing animation and state management patterns"
  form_implementations: "Follow React Hook Form + Zod validation patterns"
```

**Files to Update**:

- `.cursorrules` (add template context)
- `docs/ai-agents/template-patterns.md` (new file)

**Success Criteria**: AI consistently references template-specific patterns and avoids generic solutions

---

### **Task M2: Prevention-First Error Handling**

**Status**: ‚ùå NOT STARTED  
**Problem**: AI uses reactive debugging approaches rather than proactive validation and error prevention

**Anti-Pattern Addressed**: Reactive problem-solving leads to technical debt accumulation and repeated similar issues.

**Specific Implementation**:

Add prevention guidelines to `.cursorrules`:

```yaml
proactive_validation:
  pre_component_modification:
    - "Verify shadcn/ui component compatibility with planned changes"
    - "Assess impact on existing customizations and overrides"
    - "Validate accessibility implications of modifications"

  pre_styling_changes:
    - "Test responsive behavior across all supported breakpoints"
    - "Verify dark mode compatibility and theme consistency"
    - "Validate against design system token usage"

  pre_integration_work:
    - "Ensure compatibility with existing data fetching patterns"
    - "Verify error boundary coverage for new components"
    - "Test loading state implementations"

common_pitfall_prevention:
  - "Avoid global CSS additions outside of globals.css"
  - "Prevent shadcn/ui component update conflicts through minimal customization"
  - "Ensure loading states for all asynchronous operations"
  - "Maintain responsive design across all viewport sizes"
  - "Implement proper error states for data fetching operations"
```

**Files to Update**:

- `.cursorrules` (add prevention guidelines)

**Success Criteria**: AI proactively addresses common pitfalls rather than reactively debugging them

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES**

Based on research into AI coding anti-patterns and O3's risk analysis:

### **Context Window Degradation Prevention**

- **Problem**: Even perfect rules fail if conversation exceeds 128K tokens ([Context Degradation Syndrome](https://jameshoward.us/2024/11/26/context-degradation-syndrome-when-large-language-models-lose-the-plot))
- **Solution**: Enforce unified-diff output and 600-token response caps to prevent window flooding

### **Process Friction Management**

- **Problem**: Rigid spec/debug flows slow down minor tweaks
- **Solution**: Size gate at 15 LOC - direct patches for small changes, full workflow for complex modifications

### **Pattern Library Bloat Avoidance**

- **Problem**: Pre-cataloging solutions becomes maintenance burden ([RAG Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview))
- **Solution**: Cap template-specific patterns at ~10 high-leverage snippets, rely on existing documentation and RAG for edge cases

### **Latency Optimization**

- **Problem**: Multi-model consensus can increase response time 2-3x
- **Solution**: Single-model approach with proven models (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet) rather than consensus systems
