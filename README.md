# Next.js & Tailwind CSS Production-Ready Template

A robust, minimalist, and production-ready starter template for Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and `shadcn/ui`. Architected for stability, performance, and a superior developer experience.

This template is built on a stable foundation, having been audited and refactored to eliminate common pitfalls like dependency issues and incorrect configurations. It's designed to be "vibe code ready"‚Äîa solid base you can trust for any project.

## ‚úÖ Core Philosophy

- **Stability Over Hype:** Uses stable, production-ready dependencies. No experimental features.
- **Minimalism:** Includes only what's necessary for a modern web application, avoiding dependency bloat.
- **Developer Experience:** Configured for code quality, type safety, and fast builds.
- **Theme-Ready:** Built with a CSS variables system, making theme implementation (like dark mode) trivial.

## üí° Next Steps & Future Additions

### **How to Implement Dark Mode (2-Minute Guide)**

The architecture is already prepared for theming. To add dark mode:

1.  **Install `next-themes`**: `npm install next-themes`
2.  **Create a Theme Provider**: Create a client component that uses the `ThemeProvider` from `next-themes`.
3.  **Wrap the Root Layout**: Wrap your `<html>` or `<body>` in `src/app/layout.tsx` with your new theme provider.
4.  **Create a Theme Toggle**: Build a simple button that calls `setTheme('dark')` or `setTheme('light')` from the `useTheme` hook.
    The CSS variables in `globals.css` will handle the rest automatically.
